# Framework-for-email-app-with-security

V1.0.0
This is a rough framework for an email app, and also a testing of a concept
It has Security again OWSAP Top 10, Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) & SQL Injection.
This is done mostly by Input Validation on the client side and Server side Input Sanitization using HtmlSanitizer by Michael Ganss
and also a blacklist of disallowed inputs

For the email login you just need to use your email login

Note: This is just a proof of concept and a very basic framework for an email app
